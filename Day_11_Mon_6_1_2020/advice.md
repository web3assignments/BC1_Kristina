# Advice for crypto wallet owners
Every crypto wallet owner has to be cautious about a number of risks that are induced by this. Luckily, there is a number of steps that can be taken in order to prevent problems.

## Tips and triks

* **Paper wallets** - is a physical medium that carries the wallet key. The strongest argument for the paper wallet is that the information is not stored on the web, as we all aware, anything that is on the internet can be hacked sooner or later. However, the physical world is neither a safe place, therefore you have to take good care of making sure nobody has access to your physical carrier.
* **Password manager** - is usually a browser extension, that securely stores all your login credentials, that can be accessed by a single password. Be careful when choosing the manager, research its history to be sure that this program is trustworthy and the company was not noticed in data leakage before.
* **Multi-signature wallet** - is the type of wallet that splits your keys in multiple parts, therefore decreasing the chances of a rogue to obtain access to your wallet.
